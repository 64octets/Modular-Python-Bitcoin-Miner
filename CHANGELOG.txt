Copyright (C) 2012 Michael Sparmann (TheSeven)

v0.1.0 (final)
===================
- Handle SIGTERM gracefully
- HTTP keepalive
- Reworked work fetcher architecture (reduce work fetching overshoot, improve load balancing)
- Share upload queueing (upload a limited number of shares in parallel, queue the rest for upload)
- Improved long polling (and long poll aggregation) behavior
- Warmup clock ramping (warm up chips gracefully, yet reach full speed quicker)
- X6500Worker: Upload bitstream only if necessary (uncheck "Force bitstream upload" to enable)
- FTDIJTAGWorker: Detect crashed (deconfigured) FPGAs and reboot them
- WebUI: Add displaying of cgminer-style Utility value and effective hashrate (as seen by pool)
- New frontend module: SQLite statistics logger
- New worker module: FTDIJTAG (replaces X6500, reduces CPU load by 50%)
- New worker module: Cairnsmore (for Enterpoint Cairnsmore1 boards running Glasswalker bitstreams with auto-clocking)
- New worker module: MMQ (for BTCFPGA ModMiner Quad boards)
- Lots of bug fixes and improvements

v0.1.0 (beta)
